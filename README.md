## Inspiration
This project was inspired by https://www.interdependence.online/ made by [Jacky Zhao](https://twitter.com/_jzhao), [Jasmine Wang](https://twitter.com/j_asminewang) and other technologists from the [Verses.xyz](https://github.com/verses-xyz) organization along with the general digital garden movement. 

From seeing how powerful it is to have supporters add their digital signatures to projects and websites they support, we developed an npm package that can easily be added to any existing websites to have any online "guests" sign in to show they visited a website. As visiting personal sites are almost like visiting someone's digital home! 🌱 🏡,
