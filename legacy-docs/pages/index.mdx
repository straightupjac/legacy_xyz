# Introducing Legacy XYZ
<Callout emoji="🌱">
Build your digital legacy. A new era of social proof, and discovery of content.
</Callout>

At Legacy, our vision is to anyone to create a collection of their digital footprint and have a keepsake of all the digital content they've visited in one place. For V1, we currently support integration of signing and display of guestbooks.

For anyone who's built a project or personal website and wants to invite readers/consumers to leave their digital signature, use our [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/legacy-xyz) to leave digital signatures on your webpage.

## Supported wallets
Current version only supports injected wallet providers - Coinbase Wallet and Metamask. We plan to add support for WalletConnect and more in the future depending on demand.

## Contribute
Code is all opensource at [legacy_xyz](https://github.com/straightupjac/legacy_xyz). Please file a ticket or open a pull request!

## Send us Arweave
We maintain your projects and signatures on chain. This costs Arweave. We would be eternally grateful if you send us Arweave to this address `AaaKkDKK4yEllFoZtzv_oFjtlw7LjCZzhpZRWThIJqA` to keep this project going.
